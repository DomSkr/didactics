# Artificial Intelligence

## Requirements

Python (3.5.3 or higher) is required for this course. 

Pycharm is recommended however any other IDE/editor is fine :)  
[Install pycharm on Windows](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)  
If you choose pycharm, python can be installed without the need of another installer.

You can also do this course online by using  [Google Colab](hhtps://colab.research.google.com)
